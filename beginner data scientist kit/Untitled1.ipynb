Of course, I know the usual mumbo-jumbo about wearables and IoT-connected fitness trackers.

Relying on the promise of the 5g network expansion, IoT-powered smart devices are on the cusp of an explosive growth in adoption. It was Ericsson\\x92s Smart Car that sent me reeling:<a href=\"bit.ly/LPlNDJj\" class = \"preview\" id=\"link 3\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3802\" src=\"http://www.data-mania.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/new-IoT-device-ideas.jpg\" alt=\"Get your new iot device ideas here\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></a>\\r\\n\\r\\nThis car is connected to Ericsson\\x92s Connected Vehicle Cloud, an IoT platform that manages services for the Smart Cars to which it\\x92s connected. The Volvo pictured above acts as a drop-off location for groceries that have been ordered by its owner.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo understand how it works, imagine you\\x92re pulling your normal 9-to-5 and you know you need to grab some groceries on your way home. Well, since you\\x92re smart you\\x92ve used Ericsson IoT platform to connect your car to the local grocery delivery service (<a href=\"http://mat.se/\" class = \"preview\" id=\"link 4\">Mat.se</a>), so all you need to do is open the Mat.se app and make your usual order. Mat.se automatically handles the payment, grocery selection, delivery, and delivery scheduling. Since your car is IoT-enabled, Mat.se issues its trusted delivery agent a 1-time token to use for opening your car in order to place your groceries in your car for you at 4:40 pm (just before you get off from work).\\r\\n\\r\\nTo watch some of the amazing IoT device demos I witnessed at Ericsson Studio, make sure to go <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/LPlNDJj\" class = \"preview\" id=\"link 5\">watch the videos on this page</a></strong></span>.\\r\\n<h1>Future Trends for IoT in 2018</h1>\\r\\nNew IoT device ideas won\\x92t do you much good unless you at least know the basic technology trends that are set to impact IoT over the next year(s).
